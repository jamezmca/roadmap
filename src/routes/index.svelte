		<JobAppSection sectionName={'GitHub'}>
			<p>
				GitHub is perhaps going to be your most important online network presence. It's a great
				place to portray your skillset and employers will definitely be looking here first.
			</p>
			<p>The recipe for success on your Github page is 4 part:</p>
			<ul class="flex flex-col gap-2 list-disc list-inside">
				<li>
					Regular contributions — From the minute you start working on your projects, you ideally
					need to be making a minimum of 1 commit per day. It doesn't really matter if it's just
					adding a commented line, make the commit. Check out the Github GUI if you’re afraid of Git
					in the terminal.
				</li>
				<li>
					Three Pinned Project — These should be your primary projects, ideally on display in your
					portfolio too. It's great if these projects demonstrate different skillsets and combined,
					cover a wide array of tech. I like the following combo; a frontend framework + API
					project, an e-commerce project, and a full stack project with auth and a database.
				</li>
				<li>
					Readme.md files — These need to be pretty immaculate. A text explanation / the purpose and
					intention behind the project, problems you encountered, how you fixed them, and everything
					in-between. Each should also contain an abstract at the beginning that summarises the
					project and the technology! The format should be: Abstract, Introduction to the problem,
					why you want to fix it, how you’re going to fix it *tech used*, any issues you encountered
					along the way, overall reflection, link to live project.
				</li>
				<li>
					A friendly and professional picture and bio stating the same as your portfolio does above;
					your personality, pursuits & endeavours, and a link to your portfolio webpage and
					LinkedIn.
				</li>
			</ul>
		</JobAppSection>

		<JobAppSection sectionName={'LinkedIn'}>
			<p>
				As above, a friendly yet professional image is paramount, and same goes for your bio (links
				to Github page and web portfolio also).
			</p>
			<ul class="flex flex-col gap-2 list-disc list-inside">
				<li>
					Your title should state “Full Stack Developer”, or whatever it is that you’re aiming to
					become.
				</li>
				<li>
					You cover photo should be something visually aesthetic, that is also special to you. Think
					of it as a wall-paper for your page.
				</li>
				<li>
					You need to fill out your prior work experience and provide some detail on how any of the
					roles you have helped historically have developed your communication, team working,
					self-management and problem solving skills.
				</li>
				<li>You need to complete the education section as above.</li>
				<li>
					You need to add your list of tech skills to the skills section — if you can, try complete
					the quizzes they have to gain a badge for that skill.
				</li>
				<li>
					You need to add any certificates you have to the license and certifications section — for
					example I completed the FreeCodeCamp.org JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures
					certificate.
				</li>
				<li>Links to your main active projects and portfolio.</li>
			</ul>
		</JobAppSection>
		<JobAppSection sectionName={'Portfolio'}>
			<p>
				Your portfolio is a great place to really bring all your assets together. You can really
				personalize it to express yourself and put your best foot forward. Ideally a portfolio has a
				nice and simple intro page and clear links to your subpages/sub-sections, and also your
				other socials (LinkedIn & GitHub).
			</p>
			<p>
				There are two essential sub-sections; one is a <b>portfolio</b> page that displays all your
				of your projects (3 is the perfect number). You'll want to have links to the GitHub code and
				the live demo for each of them. The second is an <b>experience</b> page that breaks down all
				of your prior work experience and how it contributes to your hardcore developer skills.
			</p>
			<p>Best if you can acquire a SSL protected domain for your portfolio :)</p>
		</JobAppSection>
		<JobAppSection sectionName={'Projects'}>
			<p>
				Your choice of projects partially depends on what type of role you're looking for: Frontend,
				Backend or Full Stack.
			</p>
			<p>
				Select <b>3</b> from the below choices depending on what your end goal is; selecting a
				project will take you to a <b>YouTube</b> tutorial that will get you started:

		<JobAppSection sectionName={'Applying'}>
			<p>
				Now it's time to apply for some jobs; but where should you look? I found that there are four
				types of platforms worthy of your time and energy:
			</p>
			<ol class="flex flex-col gap-2 list-decimal list-inside">
				<li>
					The first place is LinkedId; LinkedIn gets a high volume of applicants but it also has an
					absolutely goliath quantity of postings - definitely worth 1 or 2 applications per day (or
					as many as you can while ensuring the quality of each application is still high).
				</li>
				<li>
					The second place is the generic job post/board local to your area; in New Zealand it is <i
						>http://www.seek.co.nz</i
					>, and in Canada it is <i>https://ca.indeed.com</i>. Some of these may work in your area
					(like Indeed).
				</li>
				<li>
					The third is smaller, more niche job boards such as Angellist/Wellfound;<i
						>https://angel.co/</i
					>. If you can find these niche boards you can get quite a good response rate.
				</li>
				<li>And finally we have intermediary recruiter sites such as Hatchways.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Some other examples are <b>StackOverflow</b> & <b>Indiehackers</b>.</p>
			<p>
				It's worth having a look at all of them and between the lot, you should be hearing back from
				prospective employers in no time.
			</p>
		</JobAppSection>

		<JobAppSection sectionName={'Networking'}>
			<h2>This section will be your magical best friend!</h2>
			<p>
				Networking is a phenomal way to increase your odds in the job market. There are a number of
				different ways that professional networking can be leveraged during your job hunt. My
				favorite ways are as follows:
			</p>
			<ul class="flex flex-col gap-2">
				<li class="flex items-center gap-4">
					<i class="fa-solid fa-code" />
					<div class="flex flex-col gap-1">
						<p>
							The first way is to find people who work for companies you like, in roles that you
							desire; this might be done on LinkedIn. I had a fair amount of success sending
							connection requests to people with a small note attached that said something like -
						</p>
						<p>
							<i
								>Hi [name], <br />I hope this message finds you well. <br />I am reaching out as
								your professional experience really caught my eye. I was wondering if you might be
								open to having a short informational interview with me? I would love to hear more
								about your story. <br />Cheers, [your_name]
							</i>
						</p>
						<p>
							These informational interviews are amazing as they can help you understand what skills
							are needed for the jobs you want, perhaps they can offer some feedback on your
							projects, and help you build connections with important people (if they like you, they
							might offer you a referral); it's basically a free interview.
						</p>
					</div>
				</li>
				<li class="flex items-center gap-4">
					<i class="fa-solid fa-code" />
					<div class="flex flex-col gap-1">
						<p>
							The second piece is equally critical and should be part of your <b>Job Application</b>
							process. The strategy is; for every job application you submit, you want to find either
							the job poster, or someone working for that company in a related role (the more senior
							the better, and I often find LinkedIn good for this search), and send them the following
							message -
						</p>
						<p>
							<i
								>Hi [name], <br />I hope this message finds you well. <br />I just noticed your job
								posting for a [insert_job_posting_title] and as a seasoned
								[insert_your_relevant_role_experience], I feel I would be a great fit for the role.<br
								/>
								I'd love to connect and chat about the opportunity. <br />Cheers, [your_name]
							</i>
						</p>
						<p>
							Once again, if they respond, it's basically a free interview; a lot of the application
							process is just getting the hiring team to meet you and see more than just a resume on
							a screen.
						</p>
					</div>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>These two steps can be paramount in helping you land a dev role.</p>
		</JobAppSection>

		<JobAppSection sectionName={'Skills'}>
			<p>In this section I just wanted to speak to one skill in particular -</p>
			<h2>COMMUNICATION</h2>
			<p>
				In a world where hundreds of other applicants can probably code just as well as you, have a
				portfolio of projects, perhaps even more university experience, <b>communication</b> is your
				single biggest weapon. As far as coding ability goes, employers just want to know that you can
				code. The person who gets the job however, is often the one who they want to work with the most.
			</p>
			<p>
				It’s absolutely critical that you’re polite in success, <i>AND IN REJECTION</i>. You cannot
				hand out enough “Thank you for this opportunity” and “I hope you’re having a nice week”.
				Friendly sentences, even a smiley face emoji makes a significant difference in displaying
				your personal affect. If you’re friendly, warm, and maybe a bit of fun, that’s how you’ll
				land your job. The other critical piece here is that you have to be able to receive
				feedback. It doesn’t matter how critical or how incorrect/unjustified you might feel it is;
				be appreciative. Say thank you. Be open minded to their words, acknowledge them, take them
				on board.
			</p>
			<p>
				You’re an inexperienced developer and you’re going to be receiving a lot of feedback so it’s
				vital that you’re humble and you take it like a champ! I cannot emphasize enough, every
				email and message should have some form of positivity. I like the template:
			</p>
			<p>
				<i
					>Hi [name],<br /> I hope you're having a great start to the week :)<br /> I wanted to say
					thank you for your time today. I greatly appreciate the opportunity to get to ......
					<br />Cheers, [your_name]</i
				>
			</p>
		</JobAppSection>
		<JobAppSection sectionName={'The Last Step'}>
			<h2>Be patient. Be persistent. Grow.</h2>
			<p>
				If you experience a rejection, take your worst project, and replace it with a new project
				that’s better than the rest. And when you land your job, you’ll know so much that you’ll hit
				the ground running and you’ll never look back.
